"time": microseconds since flight controller start
"vbatLatest": battery voltage in hundreths of volts
"amperageLatest": battery current in some unit that i dont know
"gyroADC[:]": uncorrected gyro readings
    - sampled at 8kHz. Most recent sample is taken and logged at 4kHz
    - Filtered with an internal factory tuned notch filter, and a 2nd order 
      butterworth lowpass at 258Hz break Anti-Aliasing Filter (AAF), according to
      datasheet page 26 (https://invensense.tdk.com/download-pdf/icm-42688-p-datasheet/). 
    - Scale is 16.384 units for 1 deg/s, can be increased at the cost of lower
      measurement range (now is the max, +-2000deg/s). see datasheet page 35 "FSR"
"accSmooth[:]": uncorrected acc readings, straight from the device
    Filtered with an internal 2nd order butterworth lowpass at 258Hz break frequency
    Scale is 2048 units for 1g, can probably also be adjusted
"erpm[0]": revolutions per minute of the electrical field.
    Scale is 1 units for 100 eRPMs.
    eRPMs convert to (mechanical) RPM by dividing by half the motor poles: RPM = eRPM / (poles / 2)
    For the small motor, we have 12 poles, the larger one has 14.
